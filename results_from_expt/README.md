## General

Folder containing figures from experiments with the Wasserstein metrics. Model used is DeepSet. The experiments carried out shows how well the model is trained, generalizing to unseen densities, translation invariance, scaling property and doing some barycenter experiments. We also show the encoded samples from normal densities with 0 mean and sd converging to 0, converges to dirac at 0.
